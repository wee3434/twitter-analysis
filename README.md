## Unlabelled Tweet analysis 


### 1. Objectives
To use content analysis of tweets to identify the community sentiment towards RAâ€™s (or any other diseases) drug therapies. Secondly, to study and unravel thematic clusters and topics related to these sentiments, and identify the factors that may affect patients to persist with some therapies and not others. Lastly, due to the nature of the unlabeled state and large volume of tweets, the set-up process with a use of manual annotation is impractical and expensive. The proposed framework is to find for the balance of this trade-off and efficient and effective analysis.
